This is a playground app to build and iterate through various OpenGL exercises.


### Build

Build the application using SCons with:

    scons


### Run

And then run the app binary:

    ./app


### Details

The application started out with [TheCherno's OpenGL Youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2),
which at the time of writing this document went up to episode 26, published on Sept 25, 2018.

In the process of reviewing that course for a second time, I switched from using Make to SCons in an effort to learn Scons.

After reaching the end of that tutorial, I continued on with tutorials from http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/, using the Test
framework created from TheCherno's series to facilitate running and storing each exercise.
